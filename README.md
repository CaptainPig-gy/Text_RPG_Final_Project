# CS 100 Programming Project
Problem definition: How to make a game that can be experienced as an interactive story, tailored towards the player's decisions.

Description:

We decided upon creating a game because the concept of text-based video game sounded like a fun/interesting idea for a project, seeing as how video games are one of the fields software developers may enter.
The game will be taking user input from a series of scripted options (via a terminal) and outputting a situation tailored towards that input/decision. This will continue until the player meets his/her doom or successfully chooses the right choices and gets to the ending/final situation of the game.
The game will also be programmed in C++
As far as data structures, we might be using trees where the root node represents the start of the game, and the other nodes represent decisions/outcomes. Leaves will represent good or bad endings.
Likewise, the features to be implemented are: choices presented via text through a terminal, outcomes telling the player whether or not the decision they made was a desirable one, a companion to accompany the player through this role-playing adventure, and immersive gameplay.
